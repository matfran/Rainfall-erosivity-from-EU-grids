# Rainfall-erosivity-from-EU-grids
A repository containing the code to simulate time series of rainfall erosivity events from timeseries of gridded meteorological data in Europe European data. The script processes multitemporal pixel extractions into a time series of rainfall erosivity events (EI30). The relationship between rainfall depth and rainfall erosivity is determined on per climate region based on monthly empirical relationships between the two.
